**Figure 1.** HARPS-N ΔCCFs --- Computed residual CCFs (ΔCCFs) by subtracting the mean CCF, highlighting differences in features between CCFs. For training the model, ΔCCFs is the input and the RV from stellar activity is the output. Radial velocity is indicated by its color (red = redshifted, blue = blueshifted)
